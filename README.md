# hello-world-repository
Just trying to create a repository
so this is just me trying to learn how to use github
i have made a repository and i am now creating a readme file in it

readme-edits is a copy of the main branch that you made. Its a branch of the main. All the code is copied for you to add new features that you want..
You test them. These changes that you make to the main are called commits. After this you have to add comments in the comment box and even chat with other people you
are working with about the changes you have made. This is because after making changes you have to pull them into to the main to add them to the project.
But i guess the admin is the one that approves your pull request so that your code is added to the main branch.

They are called commits or revisions because github has a record of all the changes that have been made, when and by who and it has a number to label these.
